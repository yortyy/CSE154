      <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
      <article>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "I know it's easy to imagine but it's easier to just do. See, if you can't do what
            you imagine, then what is imagination to you? Just a waste of space in your brain,
            to take the place of hate or things all the same"
          </p>
